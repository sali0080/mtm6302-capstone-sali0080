This project allows users to explore stunning astronomy pictures from NASA's APOD API by selecting a date and viewing the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD).

## Design Decisions

The design of this mockup focuses on user experience, accessibility, and visual appeal with both functionality and user experience in mind. Key design decisions include:

### 1. Simplified Date Selection Interface
- The date selection feature is designed to be straightforward, using a clean and simple date picker input. Users are instructed to enter a non-future date, ensuring clarity on input expectations.

### 2. Focus on Visual Content
- Given the visual nature of the app, the featured APOD images are displayed prominently. Descriptions and dates are provided in a subtle, subtle manner to ensure the images remain the focal point.

### 3. Favorites Feature
- Users can mark their favorite images with a "Favorite" button. This functionality encourages users to engage with the app over time and return to their saved images for future viewing directly from the website.

### 4. Orginized Image Navigation
- The app includes a orginized selection of APOD images, each accompanied by a brief description and preview. This allows users to easily browse through content in a visually engaging way.

### 5. Detailed APOD Information
- Each image is paired with detailed information including the title, date, and a description of the space event. This adds an educational informed layer to the visual experience by providing insights about the images.

### 6. Responsive Design
- The layout is responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both mobile and desktop devices. The design adjusts fluidly to different screen sizes, making the app accessible to a broad audience.

### 7. Consistent Branding
- A cohesive color palette and font choice were selected to reflect space exploration themes and align with NASA's branding. The modern, clean aesthetic enhances the professionalism of the app.

By balancing simplicity, visual impact, and engagement, this design ensures that users have an enjoyable and educational experience while exploring the universe through NASA's APOD images.
